  <ul>
    <li>i like computer architecture engeneering, which is basicaly the physical cercutry of the computer, i have made a cuple CPUs in legicy console minecraft. one of them is my favorite one because of how good it is, it has a 6 bit erethmtic logic unit, a 4 bit program counter, a 4 bit address RAM, a 5 bit instruction RAM, and a 6 bit data RAM,obveisly if the instruction RAM is  bits than the control unit is 5 bits too, and it has flag and branch logic. with it, i was able to code a graph, thats piont grow ferther away each time by an exponitiol power.</li>
